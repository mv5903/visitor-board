# Mapbox Setup Instructions

To use the map functionality, you need to:

1. Go to https://mapbox.com
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Get your access token from the dashboard
4. Replace `YOUR_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN` in `/src/lib/MapboxMap.svelte` with your actual token

The free tier includes:
- 50,000 map loads per month
- No credit card required for basic usage

Alternatively, you can use the application without Mapbox - it will show a placeholder and all other functionality will work.
